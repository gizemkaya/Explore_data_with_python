# Explore_data_with_python

In this repository, there are Jupyter Notebook files which can be helpful to start exploring and manipulating data using Python Libraries.
Data are turned into usable format and visualised for further analysis.
Basic and useful functions of various libraries are used to clean and preprocess the datasets.

Some of the topics that are covered through files:

* Reshaping the data
* Visualising the data
* Dealing with the missing values
* Dealing with the outliers
* Checking the distributions
* Exploring variations and standard deviations
